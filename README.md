The Odin Project Rock Paper Scissors Assignment 

The goal is to create a fully functional Rock Paper Scissors game. The project suggests that the user propmpt should be used, but I rather have user input through a press of a button.

Outstanding items:
- create a fix where the game ends after the game count reaches 5 and not when a user selection button is pressed for the 6th time
- replace buttons with images
- make css pretty
- add event listeners
